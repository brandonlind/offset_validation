## Outline

Notebooks are hyperlinked to be viewed on nbviewer.org, but are best viewed in a jupyter session so that cells can be collapsed or scrolled (html and nbviewer versions, links below) do not allow scrolling.

01_split_training_and_testing.ipynb - split populations into training and test sets to use for cross validation of offset methods

02_update_species_range_shapefiles.ipynb - clip future climate (or common garden climate) using species range shapefiles to ease computational burdens of gradient forests

13_consistency_of_factor_importance.ipynb - investigate the consistency of the rank of environmental importance output by Gradient Forest

14_GF_figs_with_RONA_and_climate-geo.ipynb - create figures to visualize validation of Gradient Forests, combine RONA and non-genetic validation scores

19_climate_PCAs.ipynb - create PCAs for climate that display the populations as well as the common gardens

20_look_at_validation_relationships.ipynb - look to see if the flip flop between interior varieties from the future offset is also apparent in the projection to the common garden for either GF or RONA

21_relationship_between_kfold_and_full_GF_models.ipynb - explore GF model sensitivity by looking at the relationship between the union of out-of-bag offset predictions with that of the model using all populations
